### Background

This Implementation Guide (IG) has two purposes: 
  1) to present test scripts for sending and receiving [HospitalNotification (GitHub-pages)](https://medcomdk.github.io/dk-medcom-hospitalnotification)/[HospitalNotification (IG)](https://medcomfhir.dk/ig/hospitalnotification/)) v. 3.0.0 are included. 
  2) to present test examples used in the [testprotocol for receiving HospitalNotification](https://medcomdk.github.io/dk-medcom-hospitalnotification/#2-test-and-certification).

Both test scripts and test examples are developed by MedCom. For more information, please click on the tabs above.

#### Quality Assurance Report
In the Quality Assurance report (QA-report) for this IG. An example of the errors: *Unable to resolve resource with reference '/FHIRSandbox/MedCom/HospitalNotificationTMS/HospitalNotification-fixture-SLOR.xml* and *Unable to resolve resource with reference 'http://medcomfhir.dk/ig/hospitalnotification/StructureDefinition/medcom-hospitalNotification-message'*. The errors occur when creating a test script, as the fixture and profile are not reachable in the IG. However, they are reachable from TouchStone, why it is of less concern. For vendors who uses the test scripts locally should be aware of the error and e.g. create the fixtures and define the profile locally.
